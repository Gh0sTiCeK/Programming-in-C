/*
If order to read from file, we need to create that file first. 
Then we need a pointer to file. Syntax for opening file for
reading is: f = fopen("FILE_NAME.TXT","r");
To close file: fclose(f);
We can use WHILE cycle to read characters from file and then
print them to concole. To stop reading characters a.k.a to break
the cycle, we need to make sure that in condition of cycle we use
EOF - End Of File. So it will be reading characters until the very 
end of file.

Writing to files is very similar, in fact the biggest difference in
basics is to make sure that we open file with "w" instead of "r":
f = fopen("FILE_NAME.TXT","w");
