/*
It's very important to say right from the beginning that goto
is not recomended to use. It's because it is not easy to follow
in code and it can get buggy. You should use it only when you
feel like it would be better, but keep in mind that every code
can be coded without using goto. Following code is very badly
written because you can swap goto with simple for loop, but i
chose to do it this way because is very easy to understand.
