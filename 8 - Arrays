/*
Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of 
the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think 
of an array as a collection of variables of the same type. Instead of declaring individual variables, 
such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use 
numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in 
an array is accessed by an index. All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address 
corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.
To inicialize array we need data type and some name. The inicialization can be something like this:
1. int array[] = {2,7,5,12,3}; - define all the values
2. int array[5]; - define the lenght of array
We need to consider that arrays are zero based so the index of first value (2) is array[0].
*/
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
	int i;
	int j;
	int array[] = {2,7,5,12,3};
	int arrLenght = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);
	
	//display array
	for(i=0; i<arrLenght; i++){
		printf("%d ",array[i]);
	}
}

/*
There is also way to replace some item of array, but we need to consider that arrays are zero based.
So with the command: array[2] = 6; the item 5 will be replaced for 6 -> {2,7,6,12,3}

We can also delete item from array but in that case we must subtract equal amount from lenght to the amount of 
numbers we were removing and shift other values back. Example: {2,7,6,12,3} -> lets say that we need to remove 
value 7 from this array, we need to move values 6, 12 and 3 one back.
